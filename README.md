# Face-Attendance-System-with-ArcFace-Eye-Blink-Liveness
A real-time Face Recognition Attendance System built using ArcFace for high-accuracy face embeddings, enhanced with an Eye Blink–based Liveness Detection to prevent spoofing via photos or videos. Attendance data is stored using SQLite, with future support planned for scalable databases.
